## Coding: StudentDB

Use our solution for a  [StudentDB](https://github.com/Flooooooooooorian/Ecosystem-exception-task)  and extend it according to these requirements. Download this repo and push it to a new GitHub repository in your account. Or create a fork.

-   Step 1: Extend the StudentDB with a  `findById`  method with a parameter  `id`  that returns a Student. For the self-confident: If you want to proceed test-driven (TDD, test-driven development), you can also start with step 3.
-   Step 2: The findById method should throw an appropriate exception if no student with the Id exists. Also consider what the "appropriate exception" might be. A Checked Exception or an Unchecked Exception? An instance of a predefined or a self-written exception class?
-   Step 3: Write at least one test that verifies this behavior.
